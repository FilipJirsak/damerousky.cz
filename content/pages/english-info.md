# Basic information in English
We connect people sewing masks with people who need them.

## How do I get my mask?

Enter your address or city in the box at the top right of the map and press enter. Filter the points by clicking on the green icon. Is there anywhere close to where you are?

### If you speak Czech
Select the green icon at the bottom and the map will show places that have masks available. You can also click on a yellow spot and bring 100% cotton material, such as clean sheets, and agree on the number of masks to be sewn. Some places use an order form, others take orders by email, or phone. Please note that the capacities of individual people are limited.

You can also use the distribution points. These are marked on the map by an orange icon with a building. You can easily filter places by clicking the appropriate icon at the bottom right of the map.

### If you don´t speak Czech
Contact your Czech friends or use the distribution points. These are marked on the map by an orange icon with a building. You can easily filter places by clicking the appropriate icon at the bottom right of the map.

## I don't have a mask. You can make it yourself! Long live DIY!

### No sewing and cutting

Instructions on how to make an emergency mask from a kitchen cloth and two longer softer rubber bands can be found here. Google translate can help you with the English translation. The process does not destroy the cloth.

### T-shirt style mask
You need a cotton shirt that you are not sorry to lose and some scissors. Video tutorial here, no need to understand Czech.

### How to sew a mask
Here is a nice video, and here’s another (both are English friendly). You can also hand-sew the mask. We recommend using 100% cotton for easy sterilization.

### How to take care of the mask
Make sure the mask has been sterilized before you put it on. If it wasn't, do it before you wear it. It means the cloth is washed to 60-90 degrees and then ironed thoroughly. Or you can boil the mask in a pot, then dry it and iron it.


* Masks only work when dry.
* Always sterilize the mask after use.
* You should ideally have more masks available.
