# Basic information in English
We connect people sewing masks with people who need them.

## How do I get my mask?
Enter your address or city in the box at the top right of the map and press enter. Filter the points by clicking on the **green scissors** icon. Is there anywhere close to where you are?

Alternatively, you can click on the **orange building** icon, or search for it on the map near where you are living. That´s a distribution point, where you can get a mask.

### If you speak Czech
To find where masks are available, select the green scissors icon at the bottom of the map.

If you have 100% cotton material, such as clean sheets, but can't sew, you can click on the **yellow** scissors icon, take the material there, and agree on the number of masks to be sewn. Some places use an order form, others take orders by email or phone. Please note that the capacities of individual people are limited.

You can also use the distribution points. These are marked on the map by an **orange building** icon. 
You can easily filter places by clicking the appropriate icon at the bottom right of the map.

### If you don´t speak Czech
Contact your Czech **friends** or use the **distribution points**. These are marked on the map by an orange building icon. 
You can easily filter places by clicking the appropriate icon at the bottom right of the map.

## I don't have a mask. You can make it yourself! Long live DIY!

### No sewing and cutting
Instructions on how to make an **emergency mask** from a kitchen cloth and two longer softer rubber bands can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bXqeARMuj8TUnSVzuRKfduW4RTTb8NhMP15OZwHbTew/edit). Google translate can help you with the English translation. The process does not destroy the cloth.

### T-shirt style mask
You need a cotton shirt that you are not sorry to lose and some scissors. See [the video tutorial](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B9zL5wsl6P6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), no need to understand Czech.

### How to sew a mask
This is a [nice video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDj3DVWK5QU), and [here’s another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9RWII2-5_4), both are English friendly. You can also hand-sew the mask. We recommend using 100% cotton for easy sterilization.

### How to take care of the mask
**Make sure the mask has been sterilized before you put it on.** If it wasn't, or you are not sure, do it before you wear it. Sterilization  means the cloth is washed to 60-90 degrees and then ironed thoroughly. Or you can boil the mask in a pot with hot water (you can add a little salt, or vinegar, or washing powder), then dry it and iron it.

## REMEMBER:
* **Masks only work when dry.**
* **Always sterilize the mask after use.**
* **You should ideally have more masks available.**
* **Your mask protects the others, while their mask protects you.**
* **Stay home if you can, wash your hands, keep your distance, stay safe.**
